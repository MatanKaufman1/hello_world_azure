# Hello World Azure Project

This is a simple .NET "Hello World" application configured with Azure DevOps for CI/CD. The project demonstrates how to build, test, and publish a NuGet package while integrating with SonarQube for code analysis and Azure Artifacts for package management.

---
Pipeline Overview

The Azure DevOps pipeline (azure-pipelines.yml) is designed to support two branches:

    dev branch:
        SonarQube analysis for code quality.
        Builds and packages the application.
        Publishes the package to Azure Artifacts.
        Sends an email notification with the pipeline status.
    main branch:
        Builds and packages the application.
        Publishes the package to Azure Artifacts.
        Sends an email notification with the pipeline status.

Key Pipeline Steps

    DotNet SDK Setup:
        Ensures the required .NET SDK (version 8.x) is installed.
    NuGet Tool Installation & Authentication:
        Installs the NuGet CLI and authenticates with Azure Artifacts.
    SonarQube Analysis (for dev branch):
        Prepares, runs, and publishes SonarQube results.
    Build and Package:
        Restores dependencies, builds the project, and creates a NuGet package.
    Publish NuGet Package:
        Publishes the .nupkg file to Azure Artifacts.
    Email Notifications:
        Sends pipeline status updates via email using curl and Gmail SMTP.

Prerequisites
Tools Required

    Azure DevOps with a configured agent (matanAgent).
    SonarQube server for code analysis.
    Azure Artifacts for managing NuGet packages.

Environment Variables

Ensure the following environment variables are set in your pipeline:

    GMAIL_USER: Your Gmail username.
    GMAIL_PASSWORD: Your Gmail app password (not your regular Gmail password).

NuGet Feed

    Update the nuget.config and azure-pipelines.yml file with your Azure Artifacts feed details.

How to Run the Pipeline

    Clone the repository:

    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/hello_world_azure.git
    cd hello_world_azure

    Push changes to the dev or main branch to trigger the pipeline.

    Monitor the pipeline status in Azure DevOps.

NuGet Package Details

The generated NuGet package is:

    Name: feed-matan
    Version: 1.0.{BuildId}-{SourceBranchName}

Packages are uploaded to the Azure Artifacts feed specified in the pipeline.
Troubleshooting
Common Issues

    Pipeline Fails on NuGet Restore:
        Ensure the NuGet feed is configured correctly in nuget.config.
    SonarQube Issues:
        Verify the SonarQube server URL and credentials.
    Email Notifications Fail:
        Check the Gmail username, password, and SMTP configuration.

Useful Commands

    Run the application locally:

cd src
dotnet run

Restore dependencies:

    dotnet restore
